# Comparison between SVM, KNN and ANN Predicting Heart Disease
  What we should pay most attention to some characteristics that may cause the heart disease. These features are listed in dataset with different columns, such as 
  
  sbp systolic blood pressure
  tobacco cumulative tobacco (kg)
  ldl low densiity lipoprotein cholesterol
  adiposity
  famhist family history of heart disease (Present, Absent)
  typea type-A behavior
  obesity
  alcohol current alcohol consumption
  age age at onset
  chd response, coronary heart disease

## Dataset:
  https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn//data.html
  https://www.openml.org/d/1498

## Steps:
  Data preprocessing 
  Support Vector Machine
  k-Nearest Neighbors
  Artificial neural network
  Data visualization displays 3 kinds of different results
	
## Conclusion
  I just got the fun from the hidden insights of data. And this project was inspired by the project “Heart disease prediction using 3 machine learning models.”, https://github.com/sahilverma0696/heart-disease-prediction/blob/master/main.ipynb
