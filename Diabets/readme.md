# Using Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Deep learning to predict Diabetes
About one in seven U.S. adults has diabetes now, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. With this in mind, this is what we are going to do today: Learning how to use Machine Learning to help us predict Diabetes.

## Steps:
	Data preprocessing 
	k-Nearest Neighbors
	Logistic regression
	Decision Tree and Feature Importance in Decision Trees
  Random Forest and Feature Importance in Decision Trees
  Gradient Boosting
  Support Vector Machine
  Deep Learning

## Conclusion: 
  We practiced a wide array of machine learning models for classification and regression, what their advantages and disadvantages are, and how to control model complexity for each of them. We saw that for many of the algorithms, setting the right parameters is important for good performance.
  We should be able to know how to apply, tune, and analyze the models we practiced above. It’s your turn now! Try applying any of these algorithms to the built-in data sets in scikit-learn or any data set at your choice. Happy Machine Learning!
  I just got the fun from the hidden insights of data. And this project was inspired by the project “Machine Learning for Diabetes”, https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-for-diabetes-562dd7df4d42
