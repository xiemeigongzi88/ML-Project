# Using k-Nearest Neighbors to Build Book Recommender Systems
    Virtually everyone has had an online experience where a website makes personalized recommendations in hopes of future sales or ongoing traffic. Amazon tells you “Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought”, Udemy tells you “Students Who Viewed This Course Also Viewed”. Building recommender systems today requires specialized expertise in analytics, machine learning and software engineering, and learning new skills and tools is difficult and time-consuming.

  Tools: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Sklearn 

## Steps: 
	Exploratory data analysis 
  Collaborative Filtering Using k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
  Implementing kNN

## Conclusion: 
`I just got the fun from the hidden insights of data. And this project was inspired by the project “How Did We Build Book Recommender Systems in An Hour”, https://towardsdatascience.com/how-did-we-build-book-recommender-systems-in-an-hour-part-2-k-nearest-neighbors-and-matrix-c04b3c2ef55c
