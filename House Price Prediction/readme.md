# Linear Regression Predict the Bay Area’s Home Prices
  Dataset； https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RuiChang123/Regression_for_house_price_estimation/master/final_data.csv
  This dataset was based on the homes sold between January 2013 and December 2015.

## Steps:
  Data Preprocessing
  Train and Build a Linear Regression Model
  Random Forest
  Gradient boosting
  Feature Importance

## Conclusion
  The most important features are finished sqft, zindex value, number of bathrooms, total rooms, year built and so on. And the least important feature is Apartment, which means that regardless of whether this unit is an apartment or not, does not matter to the sold price. Overall, most of these 19 features are used.
  I just got the fun from the hidden insights of data. And this project was inspired by the project “Linear Regression in Python; Predict The Bay Area’s Home Prices”, https://towardsdatascience.com/linear-regression-in-python-predict-the-bay-areas-home-price-5c91c8378878
